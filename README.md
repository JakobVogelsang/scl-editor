# SCL editor

SCL editor is a light weight editor for substation configuration language as defined in the IEC 61850-6. This editor is been created with a focus on a general user that does want to be close to the process described in the standard and an easy to maintain distribution (for long term stability).

# Scope:

It is not the goal to reach every user of SCL, nor is it the goal to support all history of the standard. Out of scope is for example:

- Edition 1 of the IEC 61850-6
- Support of multi-edition projects
-

Future implementation sorted by priority

- Open project
- Save projects
- Create new projects
- Validate against schema
- Import IEDs
- Configure control blocks
- Make subscriptions between publisher and subscriber (data binding and later binding)
- Create a substation and connect its process element to IEDs
- Export CID files
- Workflow editor that allows to have a user-defined automation
